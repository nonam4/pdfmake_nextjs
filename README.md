This is a test with [pdfmake](https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## To get the error

Start the app:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
# or
yarn build && yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and click on 'Get pdf' button to see the error.


If you run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And then click on 'Get pdf' button, everything works fine but in production it's not working.
